# Production Fixes Summary - Aksjeradar (Updated)

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Navigation Error - "Could not build url for endpoint 'main.portfolio'"
**Problem**: Multiple `base.html` files had incorrect navigation routes
**Files Fixed**: 
- `/workspaces/aksjeny/app/base.html`
- `/workspaces/aksjeny/app/routes/base.html`
- `/workspaces/aksjeny/app/templates/base.html` (already correct)

**Solution**: Updated all navigation links from `main.portfolio` to `portfolio.portfolio_index`

### 2. âœ… Navigation Error - "Could not build url for endpoint 'analysis.technical_analysis'"
**Problem**: Incorrect analysis endpoint reference in navigation
**File Fixed**: `/workspaces/aksjeny/app/templates/base.html`

**Solution**: Changed `analysis.technical_analysis` to `analysis.technical`

### 3. âœ… Missing API Endpoint - 404 on "/api/realtime/market-summary"
**Problem**: Route path had double prefix causing wrong URL
**File Fixed**: `/workspaces/aksjeny/app/routes/realtime_api.py`

**Solution**: 
- Changed `@realtime_api.route('/api/realtime/market-summary')` to `@realtime_api.route('/market-summary')`
- Blueprint prefix `/api/realtime` + route `/market-summary` = correct URL

### 4. âœ… Currency Endpoint Error - "Could not build url for endpoint 'stocks.list_currency'"
**Problem**: Missing or conflicting currency route registration
**File Fixed**: `/workspaces/aksjeny/app/templates/index.html`

**Solution**: Replaced `stocks.list_currency` with `api.get_currency` (working endpoint)

### 5. âœ… Trial Period Messaging Removal
**Problem**: 15-minute trial system removal incomplete
**Files Fixed**:
- `/workspaces/aksjeny/app/routes/main.py`: Removed `trial_active` template variable
- `/workspaces/aksjeny/app/templates/index.html`: Removed "PrÃ¸v gratis" text, changed to "Registrer deg"
- `/workspaces/aksjeny/app/templates/register.html`: Removed "gratis" from registration text
- `/workspaces/aksjeny/app/__init__.py`: Updated unauthorized handler to redirect to subscription instead of demo

### 6. âœ… Pricing Consistency Fixed
**Problem**: Inconsistent pricing across templates showing 199kr instead of 399kr
**Files Fixed**:
- `/workspaces/aksjeny/app/templates/pricing/pricing.html`: Updated to 399kr/month
- `/workspaces/aksjeny/app/templates/resources/tool_comparison.html`: Updated to 399kr/month
- `/workspaces/aksjeny/app/templates/subscription.html`: Already correct (399kr/month, 2999kr/year)
- `/workspaces/aksjeny/app/templates/login.html`: Already correct pricing display

### 7. âœ… Demo Page Completely Redesigned
**Problem**: Demo page had outdated trial messaging and poor UX
**File Fixed**: `/workspaces/aksjeny/app/templates/demo.html`

**Solution**: 
- Removed all trial period references
- Created comprehensive demo with feature comparisons
- Added visual elements showing demo vs full version
- Improved styling and user experience
- Added clear calls-to-action for subscription

### 8. âœ… Pricing Page Trial References Removed
**Problem**: Pricing page still had trial period sections
**File Fixed**: `/workspaces/aksjeny/app/templates/pricing/pricing.html`

**Solution**: 
- Removed "PrÃ¸veperiode" card completely
- Updated to show only Monthly (399kr) and Yearly (2999kr) options
- Removed all trial-related text and buttons
