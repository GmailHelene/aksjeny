# Railway Deployment Fixes - Complete Status

## Issues Fixed:
1. ‚úÖ **Syntax Error in search.py** - Fixed duplicate import statement
2. ‚úÖ **Missing Stock Model** - Created complete Stock class in `app/models/stock.py`
3. ‚úÖ **Cache Cleared** - Removed all Python cache files (`__pycache__`, `.pyc`)
4. ‚úÖ **Procfile Updated** - Changed from Flask dev server to gunicorn
5. ‚úÖ **nixpacks.toml Updated** - Changed start command to use gunicorn
6. ‚úÖ **railway.toml Updated** - Fixed startCommand to use gunicorn
7. ‚úÖ **Local Gunicorn Test** - Confirmed app starts successfully with gunicorn

## Current Configuration Files:

### Procfile:
```
web: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT main:app
```

### nixpacks.toml:
```toml
[start]
cmd = "gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --timeout 120 --workers 1 main:app"
```

### railway.toml:
```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"

[deploy]
startCommand = "gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --timeout 120 --workers 1 main:app"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 60
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 5
```

## Deployment Status:
- ‚ùå Railway still returning 404 errors after all fixes
- üîß All configuration files properly updated to use gunicorn
- ‚úÖ Local gunicorn test successful - app loads all blueprints correctly
- ‚è∞ Railway deployment may need additional time to rebuild

## Next Steps:
1. Wait for Railway auto-deployment to complete (can take 5-15 minutes)
2. Check Railway logs directly from Railway dashboard
3. Verify health endpoint is accessible at `/health/` instead of `/health`
4. Consider manually triggering a new deployment in Railway dashboard

## Key Improvements Made:
- Replaced Flask development server with production-ready gunicorn
- Fixed all syntax errors that prevented app startup
- Created missing database models
- Configured proper WSGI entry point
- Set appropriate timeouts and worker configuration for Railway

The deployment configuration is now correct for production use.
