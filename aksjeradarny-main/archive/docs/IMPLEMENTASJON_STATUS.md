# Project Implementation and Testing Status

## Completed

- Core Flask application scaffold set up (`app.py`, `__init__.py` with `create_app()`).
- Blueprint and routes organized under `routes/basic_routes.py`.
- Stub endpoints for all protected and public routes implemented and tested: `/analysis`, `/portfolio`, `/features/*`, `/login`, etc.
- Dependencies reorganized into `requirements.txt` (production) and `requirements-dev.txt` (development/tests).
- Docker and Docker Compose configuration completed (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`).
- CI/CD pipeline added with GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- Linting and formatting configured (`flake8`, `.flake8`).
- Cleanup script (`cleanup.sh`) implemented to remove legacy and unused files.
- Health-check endpoints (`/healthz`, `/readiness`) and security middleware (`flask-limiter`, CSP) in place.
- Logging with `structlog` configured.
- API documentation support added via `flasgger`.
- Tests for endpoint accessibility (`tests/test_all_endpoints_access.py`, `tests/test_frontend_urls_access.py`) passing.

## In Progress / Remaining

- Implement actual business logic for each route (replace stubs in `basic_routes.py`).
- Develop services layer logic (`services/`) and data models (`models/`).
- Add unit tests for service functions and data models to achieve â‰¥80% coverage.  
- Integration tests against staging or mock external services.
- Finalize Swagger/OpenAPI documentation and serve at `/apidocs`.
- Perform performance testing (Locust, caching, DB optimization).
- Security audit and SAST scanning (Bandit, Dependabot alerts).
- Remove stub code and rename placeholder files.

## To Do / Backlog

- Migrate existing database schema: archive old migrations and re-initialize Alembic.
- Add comprehensive user scenario tests (selenium or Cypress).
- Refine front-end templates and static assets under `templates/` and `static/`.
- Configure Pre-commit hooks (Black, isort).
- Document environment variables and setup in README.
- Finalize subscription and authentication flows with production ready database and Redis.
