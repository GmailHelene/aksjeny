# Railway Deployment Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Duplicate Health Check Routes (HTTP 500 Error)
**Problem**: The `/health` route was defined in both `app/routes/main.py` and `app/routes/health.py`, causing a route conflict during deployment.

**Fix**: 
- Removed the duplicate health check route from `main.py`
- Added health blueprint to the blueprint registration list in `app/__init__.py`

### 2. Missing Health Blueprint Registration
**Problem**: The health blueprint was not registered in the app factory.

**Fix**:
- Added `('app.routes.health', 'health', None)` to the blueprint_configs list in `app/__init__.py`

## Files Modified:

1. **app/routes/main.py**:
   - Removed duplicate `/health` route (lines 2012-2030)
   - Replaced with comment: `# Health check endpoint is now handled by health.py blueprint`

2. **app/__init__.py**:
   - Added health blueprint to registration list
   - Health blueprint is now registered first in the blueprint_configs list

## Next Steps:
1. Test the deployment locally
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Deploy to Railway

The main issue was the route conflict causing Flask to fail during startup with HTTP 500 errors. This is now resolved.
