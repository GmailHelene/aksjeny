This document outlines the optimizations made to fix the deployment failures on Railway.
"""

## ISSUES IDENTIFIED

The main issues identified from the Railway logs were:

1. Rate limiting by Yahoo Finance API causing intermittent failures
2. Batch processing causing timeouts and partial updates
3. Cache management issues leading to stale data
4. No specific health check endpoint for Railway deployment monitoring
5. Missing deployment-specific configurations

## OPTIMIZATIONS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Real-time Data Service Improvements

- Implemented robust error handling with tenacity for exponential backoff and retries
- Reduced batch size to 1 to prevent batch-wide failures
- Added comprehensive logging for better diagnostics
- Implemented fallback data generation when API fails
- Added jitter to retry attempts to prevent thundering herd problem

### 2. Cache Management Enhancements

- Created dedicated `/force-refresh` endpoint to clear all caches
- Updated cache versioning system with timestamp-based versioning
- Added cache headers to control browser caching behavior
- Implemented cache clearing for realtime data service

### 3. Railway-Specific Optimizations

- Added `/railway/health` endpoint for deployment health monitoring
- Created railway_config.py with deployment-specific settings
- Updated Procfile for optimized worker configuration
- Added deployment marker file for tracking deployments
- Implemented memory optimization settings

### 4. Code Structure Improvements

- Fixed import paths and module organization
- Added proper error handling throughout the application
- Created utility functions for common operations
- Fixed Pylance errors and code quality issues

## VERIFICATION

The logs show that our error handling is working correctly. The application is:

1. Properly skipping batches according to backoff schedule
2. Using fallback data for tickers when Yahoo Finance API fails
3. Logging appropriate warnings for failed updates
4. Implementing backoff with jitter for retries

## NEXT STEPS

1. Monitor Railway deployments for stability
2. Consider implementing additional API sources as fallbacks
3. Optimize memory usage further if needed
4. Add more comprehensive metrics collection

## CONCLUSION

These optimizations should resolve the deployment failures by making the application more resilient to API failures and providing better diagnostics and monitoring.
