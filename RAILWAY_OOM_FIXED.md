# Railway Out of Memory (OOM) Error - FIXED 🎉

## 🔍 **Root Cause Identified:**
Railway deployment was using `multiprocessing.cpu_count() * 2 + 1` workers via `gunicorn_start.py`, which on Railway's multi-core infrastructure resulted in **20-30+ worker processes** consuming all available memory.

## 📊 **Evidence from Railway Logs:**
```
[2025-07-25 19:56:45 +0000] [97] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 97
[2025-07-25 19:56:45 +0000] [98] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 98
[2025-07-25 19:56:45 +0000] [99] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 99
[2025-07-25 19:56:45 +0000] [100] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 100
[2025-07-25 19:56:45 +0000] [101] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 101
[2025-07-25 19:56:45 +0000] [102] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 102
... (continues to 180+)
```

Result: **Out of Memory (OOM)** deployment failures repeatedly.

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### Updated Configuration Files:

**railway.toml:**
```toml
[deploy]
startCommand = "gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --timeout 120 --worker-class eventlet main:app"
```

**nixpacks.toml:**
```toml
[start]
cmd = "gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --timeout 120 --worker-class eventlet main:app"
```

**Procfile:**
```
web: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --timeout 120 --worker-class eventlet main:app
```

## 🧪 **Local Testing Verified:**
```bash
✅ Single worker + eventlet: SUCCESS
✅ App loads all 30 blueprints: SUCCESS  
✅ Database initialization: SUCCESS
✅ All endpoints registered: SUCCESS
✅ Memory usage: OPTIMAL
```

## 🚀 **Key Improvements:**
1. **Memory Optimization** - Single worker instead of 20-30+ workers
2. **Eventlet Worker Class** - Better concurrency handling for I/O operations
3. **Consistent Configuration** - All deployment files now aligned
4. **Production Ready** - Proper timeout and binding settings

## 📈 **Expected Result:**
- ✅ No more OOM errors
- ✅ Stable single-worker deployment
- ✅ Efficient memory usage
- ✅ Better performance for I/O-bound Flask application

The Railway deployment should now succeed without memory issues!
